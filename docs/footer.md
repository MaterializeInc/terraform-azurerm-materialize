## Accessing the AKS cluster

The AKS cluster can be accessed using the `kubectl` command-line tool. To authenticate with the cluster, run the following command:

```sh
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $(terraform output -raw resource_group_name) --name $(terraform output -json aks_cluster | jq -r '.name')
```

This command retrieves the AKS cluster credentials and merges them into the `~/.kube/config` file. You can now interact with the AKS cluster using `kubectl`.

## Connecting to Materialize instances

Access to the database is through the balancerd pods on:
* Port 6875 for SQL connections.
* Port 6876 for HTTP(S) connections.

Access to the web console is through the console pods on port 8080.

#### TLS support

TLS support is provided by using `cert-manager` and a self-signed `ClusterIssuer`.

More advanced TLS support using user-provided CAs or per-Materialize `Issuer`s are out of scope for this Terraform module. Please refer to the [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/) for detailed guidance on more advanced usage.

## Upgrade Notes

#### v0.3.0

We now install `cert-manager` and configure a self-signed `ClusterIssuer` by default.

Due to limitations in Terraform, it cannot plan Kubernetes resources using CRDs that do not exist yet. We have worked around this for new users by only generating the certificate resources when creating Materialize instances that use them, which also cannot be created on the first run.

For existing users upgrading Materialize instances not previously configured for TLS:
1. Leave `install_cert_manager` at its default of `true`.
2. Set `use_self_signed_cluster_issuer` to `false`.
3. Run `terraform apply`. This will install cert-manager and its CRDs.
4. Set `use_self_signed_cluster_issuer` back to `true` (the default).
5. Update the `request_rollout` field of the Materialize instance.
6. Run `terraform apply`. This will generate the certificates and configure your Materialize instance to use them.
